# bluff-bot-basic
A basic bot to play the game bluff. Proof of concept before building a version using neural netowks

## Instructions:

Download the repository, run the python file. Give inputs for what is happening during the game. That is it. It will tell you what to play.

This bot uses basic strategies from the card game bluff. (It beats my friends 4 out of 5 games so I guess it works okay.)

## Demonstration:
Example of a typical round (input and output):
